            "I don't have the dream of making a million dollars; rather, 
            I have the dream of making a million smiles. I'm going to use all
            the skills that I have learned to achieve my goal. My goal might not
             be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years, but I'm going to do it no matter 
             what. I want to use my knowledge of technology to help every person I can. 
             I want to make people's lives easier. I want to be available to the people who need me
             . I want to make this society better. By 'better,' I mean a place where we can have a little free time to spend with family, 
             minimizing our work. I want to make sure this technology is used to its full potential so that we can relax for a bit. I want to achieve this
              goal by studying in the best place and getting help from poor people to rich people so that they can live freely. This might sound funny and childish,
               but I know I can do this. From my childhood, I have wanted to achieve this goal, so I believe that one day I can achieve it, no matter what steps I need 
               to take. I can achieve it, and I will achieve it
