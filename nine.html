            I make tea and drank it .In around 8AM opened my laptop and start writing code for this website. Even though I have planned to make this blog in 8 nov ,I started making 
            it in 9 nov.how ever my all day just pass by making simple website because I have to learn how to maek website from beginning. and when it was night time I got called by 
            PRASARO (yY 3   bestfriend group, I will write about them in coming day) and we start talking about different things .Pradhunna who is also member of PRASARO taught me lots of things about 
            football about champion league and premier league it was so intresting . I am not the kind of guy to play games or watch games ,how ever this champion league is so fun to watch.
            Pradhunna is fan of Man city , so he told me lots of story about their club . It was a nice day. It ws good having quality time with friends. WOW IT WAS AN AMAZING DAY .
