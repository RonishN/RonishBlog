            Hello, this is my first website. I dont know why I have started this website ,I mean I dont have any fix plan in making this web but I want to build my habit 
            of doing some productive task. This website is not stylish ,good looking and beautiful.But,I want to make this website more functionable and managed.
            Lets move to my daily routine. I didnt do anything different in this day ,I wake up at 5AM and start using my mobilephone . and just spend whole day doind
             nothing good.But I dont fill that good doing .So,I was trying to build some good habit so I planned in writing my daily summery .In first I thought writing in 
             diary will be good plan , But I look for more sufficient way and got this idea of writing my daily story in website so that I can improve my 
        self and be aware of what I am doing in my life. I think I will stop my writing here.i dont think I will be uploading my website in 8 nov becasue i have lots 
        of things to learn  like how to get domain. how to upload website and manage it, and also to make my website more fuctionable and simple as possible.
